= Adopting the data plane

Adopting the {rhos_long} data plane involves the following steps:

* Stopping any remaining services on the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) control plane.
* Deploying the required custom resources.
* If applicable, performing a fast-forward upgrade on Compute services from {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} to {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver}.

[WARNING]
This step is a "point of no return" in the data plane adoption
procedure. The source control plane and data plane services must not
be re-enabled after the data plane is deployed and the control
plane has taken control of the data plane.
