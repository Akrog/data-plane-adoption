= Adopting the data plane

Adopting the {rhos_long} data plane involves the following steps:

. Stopping any remaining services on the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) control plane.
. Deploying the required custom resources.
. If applicable, performing a fast-forward upgrade on Compute services from {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} to {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver}.

[WARNING]
After the {rhos_acro} control plane is managing the newly deployed data plane, you must not re-enable services on the {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} control plane and data plane.
