= Reviewing the {rhos_prev_long} control plane configuration

Before starting the adoption workflow, pull the configuration from the {rhos_prev_long} services and {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} on your file system to back up the configuration files. You can then use the files later, during the configuration of the adopted services, and for the record to compare and make sure nothing has been missed or misconfigured.

Make sure you installed and configured the os-diff tool. For more information, see
xref:comparing-configuration-files-between-deployments_storage-requirements[Comparing configuration files between deployments].
