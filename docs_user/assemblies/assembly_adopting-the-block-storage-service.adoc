= Adopting the {block_storage}

Adopting a {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {block_storage_first_ref} service into {rhos_prev_long} usually entails:

* Checking existing limitations.
* Considering the placement of the {block_storage} services.
* Preparing the {OpenShift} nodes where volume and backup services will run.
* Crafting the manifest based on the existing `cinder.conf` file.
* Deploying {block_storage}.
* Validating the new deployment.

This guide provides necessary knowledge to complete these steps in most
situations, but it still requires knowledge on how {OpenStackShort} services work and the structure of a {block_storage} configuration file.
