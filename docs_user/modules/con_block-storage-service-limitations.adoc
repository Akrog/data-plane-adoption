= Limitations for adopting the {block_storage}

There are currently some limitations that are worth highlighting; some are
related to this guideline while some to the operator:

* There is no global `nodeSelector` for all {block_storage_first_ref} volumes, so it needs to be
specified per backend.  This may change in the future.
* There is no global `customServiceConfig` or `customServiceConfigSecrets` for
all {block_storage} volumes, so it needs to be specified per backend.  This may change in
the future.
* Adoption of LVM backends, where the volume data is stored in the compute
nodes, is not currently being documented in this process. It may get documented
in the future.
* Support for {block_storage} backends that require kernel modules not included in RHEL
has not been tested in Operator deployed {rhos_prev_long} so it is not documented in
this guide.
* Adoption of DCN/Edge deployment is not currently described in this guide.
