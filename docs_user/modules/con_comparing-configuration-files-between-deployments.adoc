= Comparing configuration files between deployments

In order to help users to handle the configuration for the {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} and {rhos_prev_long}
services the tool: https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/os-diff has been
develop to compare the configuration files between the {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} deployment and the {rhos_long} cloud.
Make sure Golang is installed and configured on your env:
//kgilliga: Do we want to link to "https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/os-diff" downstream?
----
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/os-diff
pushd os-diff
make build
----

Then configure ansible.cfg and ssh-config file according to your environment:

[source,yaml]
[subs=+quotes]
----
Host *
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host virthost
    Hostname virthost
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    User root
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null


Host standalone
    Hostname standalone
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
    IdentityFile ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
    IdentityFile *<path to SSH key>*
endif::[]
    User root
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

Host crc
    Hostname crc
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    User stack
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

And test your connection:

----
ssh -F ssh.config standalone
