= Scenario 2: Reusing existing subnet ranges

This scenario is only applicable when the existing subnet ranges have enough IP
addresses for the new control plane services. On the other hand, it allows to
avoid additional routing configuration between the old and new subnets, as in xref:using-new-subnet-ranges_{context}[Scenario 1: Using new subnet ranges].

The general idea here is to instruct the new control plane services to use the
same subnet as in the adopted environment, but define allocation pools used by
the new services in a way that would exclude IP addresses that were already
allocated to existing cluster nodes.

This scenario implies that the remaining IP addresses in the existing subnet is
enough for the new control plane services. If not,
xref:using-new-subnet-ranges_{context}[Scenario 1: Using new subnet ranges] should be used
instead. For more information, see xref:planning-your-ipam-configuration_configuring-network[Planning your IPAM configuration].

No special routing configuration is required in this scenario; the only thing
to pay attention to is to make sure that already consumed IP addresses don't
overlap with the new allocation pools configured for {rhos_prev_long} control plane services.

If you are especially constrained by the size of the existing subnet, you may
have to apply elaborate exclusion rules when defining allocation pools for the
new control plane services. For more information, see
